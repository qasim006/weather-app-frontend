Create a website with the default page being the current weather where you live. It should also contain a text input to type in a different location by zipcode, and a link to at least another page.
This other page is up to you on what you want to implement but it could be more details on current day, 4 day forecast or whatever you want.
UI should be styled a bit, meaning no straight text, add some color and layout. Nothing too crazy but organize these pages in an acceptable way. You may use any additional libraries to help with this.
